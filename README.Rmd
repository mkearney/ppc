A simple interface for interacting with [ProPublica's Congress API](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/), which 
provides data about current and former members of both chambers of the U.S. 
Congress.

## Installation

You can install the released version of ppcong from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ppcong")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mkearney/ppcong")
```

## Examples

Get "house" data from the "116"th Congress:

```{r}
## get and preview house data from 116th congress
h116 <- ppc_members(congress = "116", chamber = "house")
h116
```

Get "senate" data from the "110"th Congress:

```{r}
## get and preview senate data from 110th congress
s110 <- ppc_members(congress = "110", chamber = "senate")
s110
```

## API Key

Use of the [ProPublica API](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/) 
requires a valid key, which you can obtain by completing the form found at the
following URL: https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api

Once you've obtained an API key, you can either include it in every request, e.g.,
``` r
## include API key in request
s116 <- ppc_members(116, "senate", api_key = "as9d78f6aayd9fy2fq378a9ds876fsas89d7f")
```

Or for the duration of any given session, you can set the API key once via the
`ppc_api_key()` function

``` r
## set as environment variable for the remainder of current session
ppc_api_key("as9d78f6aayd9fy2fq378a9ds876fsas89d7f")
```

If you'd like to set the API key and store it for use in future sessions, use 
`set_renv = TRUE`

``` r
## append as environment variable in user's home .Renviron file
ppc_api_key("as9d78f6aayd9fy2fq378a9ds876fsas89d7f", set_renv = TRUE)
```
